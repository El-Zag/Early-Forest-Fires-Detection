# Early Forest Fires Detection using Faster RCNNs
Project in collaboration with a New Caledonia company and local Firemen. 
Final code used detectron's implementation of a faster R CNN, but previous implementations had a self coded Faster R-CNN. 
Artificial Database used to improve accuracy, using fake smoke made on Blender.
This project was coded entirely by me, and relied a lot on self learned Deep Learning knowledge as it happened before my MSc in Artificial Intelligence.
